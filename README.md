# Demo

'first commit'
Description: This repo was made following a youtube video. This is an attempt to properly learn how to use GIT.

'second commit'
testing to see changes on how commits works

## Subheader

"third commit"
this was added locally 
    -- meaning on a code editor(VS Code) and not on github
index.html was created. to commit use 'git commit -m "message" '
    -- -m stands for message and commits need message, usually for why changes were made
        also you can add another -m for a description on github
        the following was used: git commit -m "Added index.html & updated README" -m "description"

        git diff branchNAME     //sees the difference between branchs with your main branch
        git merge branchNAME    //merges the branches together
        git branch -d branchNAME //Deletes the branch
        git commit -am "commit name"    // adds and commits only works formodified files
